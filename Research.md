## Developer Focus
In order of personal importance:

* [Monktoberfest](http://monktoberfest.com/faq/) - awesome topics and awesome beer. Hope to present here.
* Monitorama
* [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2015/) - highly developer-oriented and brings together 5000+ geeks from all over the world. Best way to quickly level up my skills and network in the Open Source community
* Everything by O'Reilly! 
	* Velocity 
	* OSCON
* [/dev/winter](http://devcycles.net/2015/winter/) -  appears to be target audience. May be worth targeting audience later in the year
* [CfgMgmtCamp](https://www.eventbrite.com/event/12899912987) - already in that part of the world for FOSDEM. Meeting more open source leadership from ElasticSearch to Ansible to Chef to Puppet to SaltStack. I need to build out this network and this looks right
* [OSDC](http://www.netways.de/osdc/osdc2015/overview/) (Open Source Developer Conferences) - topics include microservices, multi-model NoSQL, web security and the such. Training on Vagrant, logstash, Puppet + their leadership is there.
* AWS Re:Invent
* Hashiconf
* Kafkaconf (or whatever they're calling it)
* GitHub Universe


## Community Focus

* Community Summit 
* Dev Evangelist Summit 
* [Krispy Kreme](http://www.krispykremechallenge.com/register) - for fun. I'd be down in North Carolina. Would that be helfpul to us? It's startup central in RTP.
* The Reckoning 


####Other Outlets

* Connecting to Meetup.com groups from NoSQL to Erlang to IoT. Trending places:
  * Boston
  * NYC
  * San Francisco
