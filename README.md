Transparent Travel
==================

Update on Jan 16 - my travel as a Developer Advocate this year won't be as crazy as it could be. The real focus is getting business value and that will be more in spreadsheets than in person at first.

##Research
* [/dev/winter](http://devcycles.net/2015/winter/) -  appears to be target audience. May be worth targeting audience later in the year
* [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2015/) - highly developer-oriented and brings together 5000+ geeks from all over the world. Best way to quickly level up my skills and network in the Open Source community
* [CfgMgmtCamp 2015](https://www.eventbrite.com/event/12899912987) - already in that part of the world for FOSDEM. Meeting more open source leadership from ElasticSearch to Ansible to Chef to Puppet to SaltStack. I need to build out this network and this looks right
* [VMware PEX](https://communities.vmware.com/community/vmtn/partner-exchange) - it may be worth working from San Francisco these days to take advantage of my connection into this community. Are there teammates out here? Meetups we'd like to investigate? Users to meet? 
* [Krispy Kreme](http://www.krispykremechallenge.com/register) - for fun. I'd be down in North Carolina. Would that be helfpul to us? It's startup central in RTP.
* [OpenStack Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Openstack-Boston/events/218863008/) - Open Q: do they overlap with our users/audience? For CS?
* [OpenStack Summit](https://www.openstack.org/summit/vancouver-2015/) - If by this time we're able to setup a meetup of our community or join another community, it's worth attending this event as well for further audience expansion.
* [VMworld US  & EU](http://www.vmworld.com/community/conference/pre-reg) - by the time these roll around, I hope to be ready to have our meetups in nearby locations. This would allow a continued acquisition of my previous audience and a further activation of the new audience.
* [OSDC](http://www.netways.de/osdc/osdc2015/overview/) (Open Source Developer Conferences) - topics include microservices, multi-model NoSQL, web security and the such. Training on Vagrant, logstash, Puppet + their leadership is there.

####Other Outlets

* Connecting to Meetup.com groups from NoSQL to Erlang to IoT. Trending places:
  * Boston
  * NYC
  * San Francisco
  * Minneapolis
  * Vancouver
* Think about Open Source spaces mapped out [on Landyrd](http://lanyrd.com/topics/open-source/)
* MOAR open source here: http://opensource.com/resources/conferences-and-events-monthly
