Transparent Travel
==================

I'm going to travel a whole lot as a Developer Advocate this year. Here's my attempt to make sure this awesome community lets me know if there are opportunities I should attend.

##Research
* [/dev/winter](http://devcycles.net/2015/winter/) -  appears to be target audience. May be worth targeting audience later in the year
* [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2015/) - highly developer-oriented and brings together 5000+ geeks from all over the world. Best way to quickly level up my skills and network in the Open Source community
* [CfgMgmtCamp 2015](https://www.eventbrite.com/event/12899912987) - already in that part of the world for FOSDEM. Meeting more open source leadership from ElasticSearch to Ansible to Chef to Puppet to SaltStack. I need to build out this network and this looks right
* [VMware PEX](https://communities.vmware.com/community/vmtn/partner-exchange) - it may be worth working from San Francisco these days to take advantage of my connection into this community. Are there teammates out here? Meetups we'd like to investigate? Users to meet? 
  - [ ] Research opportunities before committing
  - [ ] Exposure opportunity by collaborating with EMCCode?
  - [ ] Community events or meetups around this time of year in the area?
* [Krispy Kreme](http://www.krispykremechallenge.com/register) - for fun. I'd be down in North Carolina. Would that be helfpul to us? It's startup central in RTP.
  - [ ] Research opportunities before committing
  - [ ] Community events or meetups around this time of year in the area?
  - [ ] Amy willing to run with me? 
  - [ ] Podcast w/Cloudcast?
* [OpenStack Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Openstack-Boston/events/218863008/) - Open Q: do they overlap with our users/audience? For CS?
* [OpenStack Summit](https://www.openstack.org/summit/vancouver-2015/) - If by this time we're able to setup a meetup of our community or join another community, it's worth attending this event as well for further audience expansion.
* [VMworld US  & EU](http://www.vmworld.com/community/conference/pre-reg) - by the time these roll around, I hope to be ready to have our meetups in nearby locations. This would allow a continued acquisition of my previous audience and a further activation of the new audience.
